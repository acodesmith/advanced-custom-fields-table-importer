# Advanced Custom Fields: Table Importer
Wordpress Plugin Add for the Advanced Custom Fields Table Field

###Requirements
 - [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com/) (Duh)
 - [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)
 - [ACF Table Fields Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields-table-field/)
 
###WARNING!
Currently *only* works on repeater fields. 

Watch out for strange characters in the CSV files.

Watch out for unescaped and unencoded single quotes in fields names.

####WP Admin Link
_Import Table_ under the Advanced Custom Fields top level menu.
Set the field up first, then use the GUI to import the CSV into the repeater field.
